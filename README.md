## Demo

You can view a live demo and some examples of how to use the various options [here](https://codepen.io/Bhavin36/full/aaVxLj/).

## Quick start

typeAhead.js requires jQuery v1.9.1+, Bootstrapâ€™s dropdown.js component, and Bootstrap's CSS. If you're not already using Bootstrap in your project, a precompiled version of the Bootstrap v3.3.7 minimum requirements can be downloaded [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/customize/?id=7830063837006f6fc84f).
